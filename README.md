# Blockchain Reading List

This is a list of readings (and watchings) on **blockchain** related topics.


## Preamble

The word _"blockchain"_ (or _"block chain"_) started off as a more or less narrowly defined technical term.

It (_"blockchain"_) later became a buzzword that represented anything related to BitCoin, alt-coins (ex: LiteCoin, Ethereum, etc), cryptocurrencies, etc.

And now that the word _"blockchain"_ is on the verge of becoming a _household name_,
it seems like it is starting to include what some others are calling _"distributed computing"_.

(In some usages of the label _"blockchain"_, neither _blocks_ or _hash lists_ seemed to be necessary for that thing to be called a _"blockchain"_.)

This seems to somewhat mirror how previously the usage of the word _"P2P"_ seemed to broaden and also include what others are calling  _"distributed computing"_.

(Although this time around, cryptography and various concepts of "money" seems to have prominence.)

Regardless, this document focuses on a more traditional definite of _"blockchain"_.


## Audience

This document is targeted at technical people, who are looking to gain a deep understand of the concepts behind blockchain based technologies.
